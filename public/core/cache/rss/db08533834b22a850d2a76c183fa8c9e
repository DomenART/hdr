<strong>Upgrading Is Critical</strong><br />
<br />
<strong>Revolution 2.5.2 contained critical security enhancements, and if you are not yet running 2.5.2 or higher, you should upgrade to 2.5.8 now. See below for more info.</strong><br />
<br />
We cannot stress the importance of diligently upgrading to the latest version of MODX enough. While no software is 100% secure, powering your site with the most current version usually helps protect you from hackers that rely on exploiting outdated software. If you’re not sure what version of MODX Revolution you’re running, log into your website Manager. If the version number doesn’t appear in the top left-hand corner of the Manager, go to <em>Manage&gt;Reports&gt;System Info</em>.<br />
<br />
If you need help upgrading your site, please contact your website builder, find a <a href="https://modx.com/support-and-services/services/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">MODX Professional</a> or get in touch with <a href="services/#engage" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">MODX Support</a>.<br />

<strong>Upgrading Is Critical</strong><br />
<strong>Revolution 2.5.2 contained critical security enhancements and if you are not yet running 2.5.2 or higher you should upgrade to 2.5.6 now. See below for more info.</strong><br />
We cannot stress the importance of diligently upgrading to the latest version of MODX enough. While no software is 100% secure, powering your site with the most current version usually helps protect you from hackers that rely on exploiting outdated software.

<br />
<strong>Upgrading Is Critical</strong> <br />
We cannot stress the importance of diligently upgrading to the latest version of MODX enough. While no software is 100% secure, powering your site with the most current version usually helps protect you from hackers that rely on exploiting outdated software. If you’re not sure what version of MODX Revolution you’re running, login to your website Manager. If it is not shown at the top left hand corner of the Manager, go to <strong>Manage&gt;Reports&gt;System Info</strong>. <br />
<br />
If you need help upgrading your site, please contact your website builder, find a <a href="https://modx.com/support-and-services/services/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">MODX Professional</a> or get in touch with <a href="https://modx.com/#engage" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">MODX Support</a>. <br />

<strong>Important Note for TinyMCE Users</strong> <br />
<br />
We have found an issue with the widely used TinyMCE Extra (the word processor-like toolbar for MODX Resources) where you cannot load Resources after Upgrading. TinyMCE by splittingred is no longer actively maintained and we recommend choosing one of the other <a href="https:/modx.com/extras/browse/?search=Tinymce" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">TinyMCE Extras</a> for 2.5.1+. There is a <a href="https:/github.com/modxcms/TinyMCE/pull/20/files" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">one-line patch available</a> if you want to continue using TinyMCE. <br />
<br />
<strong>Important</strong><br />
Nearly all releases contain vital security patches. If you are using a version lower than 2.3.6 you should consider an upgrade to 2.5.1 mandatory. <br />
<br />
<strong>Security is an Ongoing Process</strong><br />
We cannot stress how important it is to run the most current version of MODX. We are always improving security. Upgrade regularly to reduce the chance of your site getting hacked. If you need help upgrading your MODX site, <a href="http://modx.com/support-and-services/maintain/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">let us know</a>. <br />

On behalf of the entire MODX Team, <br />
We thank you! <br />";s:14:"date_timestamp";i:1469098998;}i:12;a:9:{s:5:"title";s:49:"MODX Revolution 2.5—PHP 7, Performance and More";s:4:"link";s:106:"http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/modx-announce/~3/GwSteTmyfg8/modx-revolution-2-5-php-7-performance-and-more";s:11:"description";s:6922:"MODX Revolution 2.5 is now out and brings PHP7 compatibility, ability to have faster performance for anonymous users, improved Manager interface when accessing from mobile or tablet devices, enhanced accessibility and much more. <br />
<br />
<strong>Highlights of Revolution 2.5</strong><br />
MODX Revolution 2.5 continues the tradition of enhancing functionality and performance for MODX Revolution, augmenting security, and fixing a variety of bugs. The excellent new features include the following areas:<br />
<br />
<strong>Preparing for the Future</strong><br />
MODX CMS has alway been forward thinking. We adopted PDO for database access years before others even considered it, and you could power HTML5/CSS3 mobile responsive sites with our first release in 2005, even though those technologies didn’t exist at the time. We continue this tradition with a few things that are here today, and that will be huge soon:<br />
<ul class="dis-ul"><br />
    <li>PHP 7 compatibility (it’s coming soon to a server near you). PHP 7 performs significantly faster than any previous release before it so your sites should be able to handle more visitors and serve them more quickly, keeping them engaged and returning for more.</li>
    <li>Accessibility improvements worked into the core Manager experience including screen reader and keyboard navigation on the Login screen. The work that is going on for the Accessible Manager theme that takes this much further, works in MODX Revolution 2.5, too.</li>
</ul>
<br />
<strong>Improved UX</strong><br />
<img src="https://modx.com/assets/i/blogs/ryan/25-mobile-sim-collage.png" border="0" /><br />
Our quest to improve end-user and developer experiences will never be over. To that point, the following areas received attention for 2.5:<br />
<ul class="dis-ul"><br />
    <li>New default content for new installs provides helpful resources and information. Instead of the empty blank page in all previous versions of MODX Revolution, you now get a nice intro page with some important links to assist and orient new users.</li>
    <li>Much more mobile-friendly Manager. As a stepping stone towards a new Manager in the future, this allows you to make edits and access the Manager much more easily than was possible before thanks to the <a href="https://github.com/modxcms/revolution/pull/12776" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"> intense efforts of JP Devries</a>.</li>
    <li>Add ability to unpack zip files in the file tree / media manager</li>
</ul>
<br />
<strong>Developer Sugar</strong><br />
Sometimes you need to create custom functionality that available MODX Extras do not address. Often this involves creating a Custom Manager Pages and interfaces inside a Component.<br />
<br />
Previously, this required a dive into the “exciting” world of ExtJS, with which most people have a loathe-hate relationship. Now, views for applications you build into the MODX Manager are much easier to create using plain old HTML/CSS and MODX Tags. A special thanks goes to Romain Tripault and Susan Ottwell for this <a href="http://modxcookbook.com/customize-manager/cmps/cmp-made-easy.html" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">example of the new Custom Manager Pages in 2.5</a>.<br />
<br />
<strong>Faster Performance</strong><br />
Google loves fast sites, as do your visitors. MODX has always been performant when serving cached pages, now it’s even more so:<br />
<ul class="dis-ul"><br />
    <li>Parser optimizations which improve pre-caching performance. This means visitors will be served more quickly, and Google will give your site a little more respect, which it clearly deserves.</li>
    <li>The new <em>anonymous_sessions</em> setting (enabled by default) can significantly speed up the performance for sites that don’t need to have PHP sessions or logged in users. When this setting is disabled, and a page is fully cached, having sessionless anonymous visitors eliminates the need for a database connection for that visitor on each request. If your site serves even moderate traffic, this can significantly reduce the amount of processor required to operate. </li>
</ul>
<br />
<strong>Changes in MODX Revolution 2.5</strong><br />
Previously created sites, currently on Revolution 2.3 or above, should work when upgrading to 2.5, but we do suggest testing on an clone of your site, first. Earlier versions may take a bit of extra effort and code updates if they use non-public APIs or directly access the database.<br />

<br />
<strong>Highlights of Revolution 2.5</strong><br />
MODX Revolution 2.5 continues the tradition of enhancing functionality and performance for MODX Revolution, augmenting security, and fixing a variety of bugs. The excellent new features include the following areas:<br />
<br />
<strong>Preparing for the Future</strong><br />
MODX CMS has alway been forward thinking. We adopted PDO for database access years before others even considered it, and you could power HTML5/CSS3 mobile responsive sites with our first release in 2005, even though those technologies didn’t exist at the time. We continue this tradition with a few things that are here today, and that will be huge soon:<br />
<ul class="dis-ul"><br />
    <li>PHP 7 compatibility (it’s coming soon to a server near you). PHP 7 performs significantly faster than any previous release before it so your sites should be able to handle more visitors and serve them more quickly, keeping them engaged and returning for more.</li>
    <li>Accessibility improvements worked into the core Manager experience including screen reader and keyboard navigation on the Login screen. The work that is going on for the Accessible Manager theme that takes this much further, works in MODX Revolution 2.5, too.</li>
</ul>
<br />
<strong>Improved UX</strong><br />
<img src="https://modx.com/assets/i/blogs/ryan/25-mobile-sim-collage.png" border="0" /><br />
Our quest to improve end-user and developer experiences will never be over. To that point, the following areas received attention for 2.5:<br />
<ul class="dis-ul"><br />
    <li>New default content for new installs provides helpful resources and information. Instead of the empty blank page in all previous versions of MODX Revolution, you now get a nice intro page with some important links to assist and orient new users.</li>
    <li>Much more mobile-friendly Manager. As a stepping stone towards a new Manager in the future, this allows you to make edits and access the Manager much more easily than was possible before thanks to the <a href="https://github.com/modxcms/revolution/pull/12776" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"> intense efforts of JP Devries</a>.</li>
    <li>Add ability to unpack zip files in the file tree / media manager</li>
</ul>
<br />
<strong>Developer Sugar</strong><br />
Sometimes you need to create custom functionality that available MODX Extras do not address. Often this involves creating a Custom Manager Pages and interfaces inside a Component.<br />
<br />
Previously, this required a dive into the “exciting” world of ExtJS, with which most people have a loathe-hate relationship. Now, views for applications you build into the MODX Manager are much easier to create using plain old HTML/CSS and MODX Tags. A special thanks goes to Romain Tripault and Susan Ottwell for this <a href="http://modxcookbook.com/customize-manager/cmps/cmp-made-easy.html" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">example of the new Custom Manager Pages in 2.5</a>.<br />
<br />
<strong>Faster Performance</strong><br />
Google loves fast sites, as do your visitors. MODX has always been performant when serving cached pages, now it’s even more so:<br />
<ul class="dis-ul"><br />
    <li>Parser optimizations which improve pre-caching performance. This means visitors will be served more quickly, and Google will give your site a little more respect, which it clearly deserves.</li>
    <li>The new <em>anonymous_sessions</em> setting (enabled by default) can significantly speed up the performance for sites that don’t need to have PHP sessions or logged in users. When this setting is disabled, and a page is fully cached, having sessionless anonymous visitors eliminates the need for a database connection for that visitor on each request. If your site serves even moderate traffic, this can significantly reduce the amount of processor required to operate. </li>
</ul>
<br />
<strong>Changes in MODX Revolution 2.5</strong><br />
Previously created sites, currently on Revolution 2.3 or above, should work when upgrading to 2.5, but we do suggest testing on an clone of your site, first. Earlier versions may take a bit of extra effort and code updates if they use non-public APIs or directly access the database.<br />
<br />

Speaking of things that don&#039;t happen often, It&#039;s been 15 months since the last release of MODX Evolution. The international community-led team that is behind the current release, have made some important changes since that time including replacing the frameset in the Evo Manager with iFrames, virtually eliminated the document Resource limitations, and the team has worked very hard to make Evo fully compatible with PHP 5.6 through to PHP 7.<br />
<br />
Due to the time since the previous release and the significant number of changes for both security and PHP server compatibility, Evolution 1.1 should be considered mandatory update/upgrade for all users of MODX Evo 1.0.15 and below.<br />

Quick stats on the multitude of changes that increase the capabilities of Evo for the release of MODX Evolution 1.1:<ul class="dis-ul"><br />
<li>Bugfixes: 44</li>
<li>Refactor: 35</li>
<li>Additional Improvements &amp; Updates: 35</li>
<li>Commits: 322</li>
<li>Files changed: 293</li>
<li>Participants: 21</li>
</ul>
<br />
<strong>Important changes to note:</strong><ul class="dis-ul"><li>Deprecated Mysql replaced with Mysqli, to ensure compatibility with PHP 5.6 +</li>
<li>Manager no-longer uses a frameset, it now uses iFrames</li>
<li>New manager setting &quot;AliasListingFolder&quot; - Setting =&gt; Friendly URLs (tested with 1000000 documents, no more limits for documents)</li>
<li>DocLister is now a default snippet - <a href="https://rtfm.modx.com/extras/evo/doclister/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">English documentation</a> can be found in the RTFM, courtesy of &quot;kp52&quot; who translated the official Russian documentation</li>

Speaking of things that don&#039;t happen often, It&#039;s been 15 months since the last release of MODX Evolution. The international community-led team that is behind the current release, have made some important changes since that time including replacing the frameset in the Evo Manager with iFrames, virtually eliminated the document Resource limitations, and the team has worked very hard to make Evo fully compatible with PHP 5.6 through to PHP 7.<br />
<br />
Due to the time since the previous release and the significant number of changes for both security and PHP server compatibility, Evolution 1.1 should be considered mandatory update/upgrade for all users of MODX Evo 1.0.15 and below.<br />
<br />
Quick stats on the multitude of changes that increase the capabilities of Evo for the release of MODX Evolution 1.1:<ul class="dis-ul"><br />
<li>Bugfixes: 44</li>
<li>Refactor: 35</li>
<li>Additional Improvements &amp; Updates: 35</li>
<li>Commits: 322</li>
<li>Files changed: 293</li>
<li>Participants: 21</li>
</ul>
<br />
<strong>Important changes to note:</strong><ul class="dis-ul"><li>Deprecated Mysql replaced with Mysqli, to ensure compatibility with PHP 5.6 +</li>
<li>Manager no-longer uses a frameset, it now uses iFrames</li>
<li>New manager setting &quot;AliasListingFolder&quot; - Setting =&gt; Friendly URLs (tested with 1000000 documents, no more limits for documents)</li>
<li>DocLister is now a default snippet - <a href="https://rtfm.modx.com/extras/evo/doclister/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">English documentation</a> can be found in the RTFM, courtesy of &quot;kp52&quot; who translated the official Russian documentation</li>

The latest release of MODX Revolution is a minor version upgrade to 2.4.0. This release adds package dependencies along with over 70 improvements. <br />

Highlights are listed below, but check out the <a href="https:/raw.githubusercontent.com/modxcms/revolution/v2.4.0-pl/core/docs/changelog.txt" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">changelog</a> for the play-by-play. <ul class="dis-ul"> <li>Package Dependencies!

</li>
<li>Some improvements have been made to the accessibility of the Manager UI. We&#039;ve got a ways to go yet, but this version sets the stage better than any previous version. <br />
</li>
<li>Heroic and necessary steps were taken towards making MODX fully <strong>testable</strong>, thanks to @markwillis82. <br />
</li>
<li>Everyone loves performance optimization, and new database indexes in 2.4 deliver the warm fuzzies. <br />
</li>
<li>Better UX, stability, security and overall goodness abound. <br />
